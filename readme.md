# Explanation
This is just a repo to hold the programs I have wrote while learning the CH32V hardware using ch32fun. 

The ideas for the example programs largely come for the textbook Learning the Art of Electronics.

# Running the programs
Once platformio is installed and working I have created these programs by creating a new project for each. I then open the specific folder in the integrated terminal and run:

```
pio run --target clean
pio run --target upload
```

and it uploads it. More and better information can be found on the ch32fun repo.
